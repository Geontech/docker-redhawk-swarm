# Docker Redhawk Swarm

This repository contains Docker Compose files and scripts for deploying a [Redhawk](http://geontech.com/redhawk-sdr/) application to a Docker Swarm.

## Prerequisites

### Docker

This guide requires that you have installed Docker CE and Docker Compose on each machine that you are using to launch the [Redhawk](http://geontech.com/redhawk-sdr/) application. For the purposes of following along with the command syntax in this guide, you should have a Unix-based operating system and the `docker` daemon should be configured to run with administrative privileges. Docker CE version `17.06.0-ce` and Docker Compose version `1.15.0` were used for this guide.

* See the guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) to install Docker CE.
* See the guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user) to configure the `docker` daemon to have administrative privileges.
* See the guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to install Docker Compose.

### Docker Images

The following Redhawk images are used to create the Docker Stacks. These images are pulled from Geon Technologies' Docker Hub [registry](https://hub.docker.com/u/geontech/dashboard/). Internet access to this registry is all you need!

* `geontech/redhawk-omniserver:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-domain:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-gpp:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-bu353s4:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-usrp:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-rtl2832u:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-development:2.0.6`

> Note: Swarm compatibility for these images was introduced with the `2.0.6-1` tag of the [source code](https://github.com/Geontech/docker-redhawk).

In addition to the Redhawk images, we are also using the visualization tool from the Docker Hub Samples [registry](https://hub.docker.com/u/dockersamples/dashboard/). This image is not required for the run-time capabilities of the Redhawk application, but it is useful to view the Docker Containers that have been deployed to Swarm Nodes.

* `dockersamples/visualizer`

### Using a Local Registry (optional)

If your machines do not have internet access or you want to build your own custom Redhawk images, you must set up a local Docker registry server. Setting up a local registry is outside the scope of this guide, but here is an overview of the process:

1. Use our guide [here](http://geontech.com/introduction-docker-redhawk/) to build the Redhawk images.
2. Setup a local Docker registry server using the guide [here](https://docs.docker.com/registry/deploying/).
3. Tag each image with a prefix containing the hostname and port of the local registry  instead of `geontech/`, and then push the images to the local registry.

The following commands give an example of steps 2 & 3 above:

    $ docker service create --name registry --publish 5000:5000 registry:2
    $ docker tag geontech/redhawk-omniserver computer1:5000/redhawk-omniserver
    $ docker push computer1:5000/redhawk-omniserver

Next, you will need to update the Docker Compose files and the Docker Engine running on each Swarm Node:

1. Update the image names in `rh.yml` and `rhide.yml` to have the prefix mentioned above. For example, `geontech/redhawk-omniserver:2.0.6` will be changed to `computer1:5000/redhawk-omniserver`.
2. Each machine will need the `"insecure-registries":[â€œcomputer1:5000"]` key added to `/etc/docker/daemon.json` if your local registry server doesn't have valid SSL certificates. If you want to use valid SSL certificates, see our guide [here](http://geontech.com/using-letsencrypt-ssl-internally/) on setting up an SSL server with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Setting up the Docker Swarm

A Docker Swarm is a distributed computing cluster that is composed of one or more machines, or Swarm Nodes. The Swarm allows us to deploy Redhawk Docker Containers to multiple machines, achieving the goal of a distributed Software-Defined Radio processing environment! If you only have a single machine to create a Swarm and deploy your Redhawk application, that's OK! Some of us just enjoy being a Swarm of one, so keep reading!

### Initializing the Swarm

A Swarm must be initialized before Nodes can join the Swarm, and the machine that initializes the Swarm is automatically declared a Swarm Manager. A Swarm Manager is an active Swarm Node that controls actions for the Swarm, most notably deploying and removing Docker Stacks. Use the following terminal command to initialize the Swarm on a Manager:

    $ docker swarm init

You now have a fully functional Docker Swarm comprised of a single Docker Manager!

> Note: If you don't have any more machines to add to the Swarm, you should skip to the "Deploying the Redhawk application on the Swarm" section.

In order to add Nodes to the Swarm, we first need to get the tokens that allow us to join the Swarm as either a Manager or Worker. Execute the following command from the Manager to get the Manager token:

    $ docker swarm join-token manager

The output of this command has the following format:

    docker swarm join --token <manager_token> <ip_address>:2377

Save this command to use in the following steps, or just use your eidetic memory to remember the Manager token and IP address.

In contrast to a Manager, a Swarm Worker is a passive Node that runs Docker Containers based upon the deployments from the Swarm Manager. We now need to get the token for joining a Worker to the Swarm:

    $ docker swarm join-token worker

The of this command will look nearly identical to the output above, and only the token will be different:

    docker swarm join --token <worker_token> <ip_address>:2377

Save this command also for use in the following steps.

### Adding Nodes to the Swarm

Now that we have initialized our Docker Swarm and retrieved the tokens, we can start adding Nodes to the Swarm! Make sure you add a Node as a Manager if you intend to launch the Redhawk IDE from that Node. For production Swarms, you should follow these [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/admin_guide/).

> Reminder: You must have Docker CE and Docker Compose installed on each machine you intend to join to the Swarm!

Execute the following command within the terminal of each machine that you would like to become a Swarm Worker, using the `<worker_token>` and `<ip_address>` from the "Initializing the Swarm" section above:

    $ docker swarm join --token <worker_token> <ip_address>:2377

Execute the following command within the terminal of each machine that you would like to become a Swarm Manager, using the `<manager_token>` and `<ip_address>` from the "Initializing the Swarm" section above:

    $ docker swarm join --token <manager_token> <ip_address>:2377

That's it - the Nodes have been registered with the Swarm! To view all the Nodes in your swarm, execute the following command from the terminal of any Swarm Manager:

    $ docker node ls

The `Leader` Manager status indicates the Node that initialized the Swarm, and the `Reachable` Manager status marks all other Managers.

### Configuring a Node for a USB Device (optional)

Additional steps are required to configure a Node to use a USB device required by the Docker Images below. If you don't intend to use any USB devices, you may skip this section.

* `geontech/redhawk-bu353s4:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-usrp:2.0.6`
* `geontech/redhawk-rtl2832u:2.0.6`

The devices that are currently supported and tested are:

* USRP: Ettus B200 Mini
* GPS: bu353s4
* RTL SDR: NooElec R820T

The first step is to download and install the [docker-swarm-usb](https://github.com/Geontech/docker-swarm-usb/) package on each machine that has a supported USB device. The instructions for this installation are located in the `README.md` file of the repository.

The next step is label each Node with the device name. Execute the following command from any Swarm Manager for Nodes that have an Ettus B200 Mini attached:

    $ docker node update <NODE_HOSTNAME> --label-add "usrp_b200=true"

Execute the following command from any Swarm Manager for Nodes that have a bu353s4 GPS attached:

> Note: Currently the bu353s4 ***must*** be mounted at `/dev/ttyUSB0`, so make sure it is the first serial USB device you plug in to your machine!

    $ docker node update <NODE_HOSTNAME> --label-add "bu353s4=true"

Execute the following command from any Swarm Manager for Nodes that have an RTL SDR attached:

    $ docker node update <NODE_HOSTNAME> --label-add "rtl2832u=true"

## Deploying the Redhawk application on the Swarm

In Docker language, each Docker Container that makes up the Redhawk application is considered a Docker Service. A collection of these services defined in a Docker Compose `.yml` file is considered a Docker Stack.

To deploy the Redhawk application, execute the following command from the terminal of any Swarm Manager:

    $ ./rh start

The Redhawk application is now deployed as a Docker Stack on your Docker Swarm! To view the Containers and the Swarm Nodes on which they were deployed, execute the following command:

    $ ./rh

To remove the Redhawk application, execute the following command from the terminal of any Swarm Manager:

    $ ./rh stop

To have a visual perspective of the Docker Containers and Swarm Nodes, open a web browser and navigate to http://`<ip_address>`:8080/ , using the `<ip_address>` from the Swarm Manager from above. You are now ready to implement SDR waveforms in your distributed computing Redhawk application!

## Deploying the Redhawk IDE on the Swarm

A separate Docker Compose file exists for launching the Redhawk IDE, meaning that a separate Docker Stack will be created for the IDE. Although the Stack is separate, it still shares the same volume and network created by the `rh.yml` file. Therefore, the `rhide.yml` file <b>must</b> be deployed after the `rh.yml` file.

To deploy the Redhawk IDE, execute the following command from the <b>local</b> terminal of the Swarm Manager you used to deploy the Redhawk application (make sure it has a display!):

    $ ./rhide start

The Redhawk IDE is now deployed on your Swarm, and the GUI is exported back to your display. Execute the following command to view any running Redhawk IDEs in your Swarm:

    $ ./rh

To remove the Redhawk IDE, execute the following command from the terminal of any Swarm Manager:

    $ ./rh stop

Currently only one Redhawk IDE may be deployed to the Redhawk Swarm at a time.

## Stopping the Docker Swarm

To kill the entire Docker Swarm and disconnect all Workers, execute the following command from the terminal of all Swarm Managers:

    $ docker swarm leave --force

To disconnect an individual Worker from the Swarm, execute the command above from the terminal of the Swarm Worker without the `--force` switch:

    $ docker swarm leave

## Troubleshooting

Here is a list of issues that you may face with their solutions:

* <b>I can connect to my Redhawk Domain, but I don't see all of my Devices!</b> You may need to disable the firewall for all your Swarm Nodes to allow the Device Manager to connect. This behavior is documented in Section 2.3.1 of the [Redhawk Manual](https://redhawksdr.github.io/Documentation/mainch2.html).
* <b>When executing `docker swarm init` I receive the message, "Error response from daemon: --live-restore daemon configuration is incompatible with swarm mode".</b> Remove `"live-restore":true` from your `/etc/docker/daemon.json` configuration file.
* <b>When executing `docker swarm init` I receive the message, "Error response from daemon: could not choose an IP address to advertise since this system has multiple addresses on different interfaces ... - specify one with --advertise-addr".</b> Use the following format of the command: `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <ip_address>`.
